# Overview
This is a setup for configuring tintin++ for MUDD games.  Heavy inspiration and copy-pasta taken from [bonginc/lotj-2024-local](https://github.com/bonginc/lotj-2024-local).  I personally like to read and write the code myself to learn what is happening.

## Prerequisites
1. [TinTin++]() Installed locally.
